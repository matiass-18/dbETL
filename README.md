The process is:
-> First, I got the database in a .csv format, then in excel I organized some data and renamed the file to "limpia.xlsl"
-> In Python, using Pandas, I fill the empty fields with "sin informacion" to avoid "Null" Values and then create a new file in .json format.
-> Now you will be able to see the cleaner and more organized database.

Update:

-> The new Python code, removes spaces in heades, modificating the previous file to a new one "dbJson_modificado.json"

Second Update:

-> The new Python file rename spanish fields to english and create a new .json -> "dbJson_english.json"
